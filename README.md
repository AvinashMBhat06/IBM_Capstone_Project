# IBM_Capstone_Project


In my capstone project, I focused on predicting the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage. SpaceX prominently showcases Falcon 9 rocket launches on its official website, emphasizing a cost of 62 million dollars per launchâ€”a substantial cost advantage compared to other providers whose prices soar upwards of 165 million dollars each. This significant cost reduction primarily stems from SpaceX's innovative approach of reusing the first stage.

By successfully predicting whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land, I aimed to determine the overall cost of a launch. This information holds strategic significance, especially in scenarios where an alternative company intends to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch contract. Analyzing and forecasting the success of the first stage landing not only contributes to understanding the dynamics of SpaceX's cost-effective operations but also provides valuable insights for competitors looking to enter the rocket launch market
